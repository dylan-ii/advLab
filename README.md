code repository for all analysis related to Advanced Laboratory (PHYS 4701) and its labs

virtual lab:
  * investigation of blackbody radiation, voltage vs angle dependence, voltage vs temperature dependence
  * estimation of stefan-boltzmann constant
  * estimation of power law of relationship between voltage and temperature

charge to mass ratio:
  * measures charge to mass ratio of electron
  * varied accelerating voltage, magnetic field current (through a helmholtz coil) and measured beam radii
  * weighted avg of linear regressions between current and radii (alongside consts) gave e/m
